--------

This set of Python scripts adds APC20 functionality to the APC40. Compatible with Live 8, on PC or mac.

To use, drop the APC40_20 folder into Ableton's MIDI Remote Scripts directory, and select APC40_20 from the MIDI Preferences dialog. Switch Track Input to "On" for Note Mode.

Modifications and customizations include the following:

- A Note Mode has been added; select with the Master button. Use Shift + Master for Master Track Select.
- Sliders are remappable using Shift + Arm buttons. 8 Modes are available (from left to right): Vol, Pan, Send A, Send B, Send C, User 1, User 2, User 3.
- Cue Level is mapped to Tempo. Use Shift + Cue for cue volume.
- Metronome is mapped to Device Lock. Use Shift + Tap Tempo for metronome.
- Nudge Tempo+ and Nudge Tempo- are mapped to Undo and Redo. There is no Nudge Tempo control.
